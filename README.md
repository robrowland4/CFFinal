Final project for CareerFoundry Data Immersion Course
Motive: Baseball has been around since the late 1800's, and like anything else, has experienced many changes during that time. This analysis examined the affect that time and geography (home team location) have on overall player performance.
Data: This data includes every qualified hitter season in the Live Ball Era (1920-present). A qualified hitter must have 3.1 at bats for every team game played.
Hypothesis #1: Due to modern medicine and technology, player performance has increased since 1920.
Hypothesis #2: Geographic location does not have a significan impact on player performance.
